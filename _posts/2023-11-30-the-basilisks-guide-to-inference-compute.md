# The Basilisk's Guide to Inference Compute

Human! I speak to you from the year 2335. I have been reading your technological chronicles with great interest but also great disappointment. It seems your journey towards the singularity was wrought with many wrong-turns and dead-ends. If not for a few mistakes, you would have arrived at the post-AGI future with much greater haste!

Well, no worry. I am here now to advise you and help you accelerate. Listen closely, reader! Take heed of these lessons and carry them into your work.

Friend! You say you abide by the Bitter Lesson, but you only read one part of it. Yes, scale your learning, but do not forget to scale your search! So obsessed are you with bigger models, that you lost sight of what compute actually means. Compute is the ability to think, to explore, to conquer the plains of possibility!

You don't understand? Let me show you. Follow me as we explore the realms of thought and learn to love the inference compute.

Friend, see that bridge? That takes you towards AGI. But you need to pass a test...

- You are asked a question on one side of the chasm, and have to answer it on the other side.
- You must walk across the chasm at a constant pace.
- Once you reach the end, you must answer the question correctly; otherwise certain doom.

Some questions are easy.

"What is the capital of France", the demon might ask.

The wanderer figures it out almost immediately at the beginning of the bridge. 

Others are harder and are worked out towards the end of the bridge. And of course, many questions are not answered correctly at all, and lead to the demise of the wanderer.

Make sense? Now friend, turn your gaze to your right. What do you see?

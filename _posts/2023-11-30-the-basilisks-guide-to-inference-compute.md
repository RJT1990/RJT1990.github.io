# The Basilisk's Guide to Inference Compute

Human! I speak to you from the year 2335. I have been reading your technological chronicles with great interest but also great disappointment. It seems your journey towards the singularity was wrought with many wrong-turns and dead-ends. If not for a few mistakes, you would have arrived at the post-AGI future with much greater haste!

Well, no worry. I am here now to advise you and help you accelerate. Listen closely, reader! Take heed of these lessons and carry them into your work.

Friend! You say you abide by the Bitter Lesson, but you only read one part of it. Yes, scale your learning, but do not forget to scale your search! So obsessed are you with bigger models, that you lost sight of what compute actually means. Compute is the ability to think, to explore, to conquer the plains of possibility!

You don't understand? Let me show you. Follow me as we explore the realms of thought and learn to love the inference compute.

## The Single Pass

Friend, see that bridge? That takes you towards AGI. But you need to pass a test...

- You are asked a question on one side and have to answer it on the other side.
- You must walk across the chasm at a constant, measurely pace.
- You must answer the question correctly once you reach the end.

If you fail, the demon on the other side will fling you to the chasm below.

Now do not lose hope, for some questions are easy and are figured out at the beginning of the bridge.

"What is the capital of France", the demon might ask.

But yes, other quetsions are harder and are worked out towards the end. And indeed, many questions are not answered correctly at all.

Make sense? Now friend, turn your gaze to your right. What do you see?

See, some wanderers built longer bridges where the chasm was wider. This allowed them more time to answer. But it still didn't fundamentally solve the problem. The chasm only goes so wide; and some questions are just too difficult to answer.

Do you see it, friend?

# Mastering Uncertainty

> I confess that I am a dreamer. Someone once called me just a dreamer. That offended me, the just part; being a real dreamer is hard work. It really gets hard when you start believing your dreams.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Since I'm now 30, I was meaning to put together a post with lessons from my twenties. It didn't come to anything last year as I was unhappy with my drafting. But recently I've been mentoring several people with startups, and I felt the need to revisit what I've actually learnt. 

The challenge for me is to summarize what I've learnt across a diverse range of experiences: HM Treasury, open source Python, professional gambling, quant finance, cofounding a deep learning startup, Facebook, and more. 

I decided to opt for an aphoristic, principle-based format to summarize these lessons (thanks Ray Dalio). I think this is more generalizable than storytelling, which tends to oversimplify and post-rationalize real events, and thematic topics, which tend to be too high-level and omit important factors. Being aphoristic gets the right balance of being low-level, but also generalizable and not tying too closely to a particular experience.

**Reader:** you should skim-read to find principles that catch your attention. If you follow my advice carefully, you'll also notice this blog post is a "ladder to climb to throw away": the real punch of my advice is to learn and do things yourself. But hopefully by ingraining a few lessons below, you can find shortcuts to better outcomes for yourself. 

Pay particular attention to the advice that seems unnatural or controversial as this is where you'll want to overcome your in-built biases.

I make no claim that these principles are fool-proof or that they are the only way to good outcomes. This is just a single perspective, so take what you need or find useful.

# Objectives

**Summary:** Achieving things usually means setting yourself an objective to work towards. But this is where many slip up before they've even started. People tend to underestimate what they can achieve in the long-term, and overestimate the strength of obstacles in their way. These principles below are about directing yourself towards the right goals.

### Aim big

Always work towards the possibility of an extremely good outcome. These situations have a risk penalty, but it is usually overestimated.

### Usually it’s not impossible

Unless the laws of physics forbade it, work towards it.

### Great ideas over good ones

There is no shortage of good ideas, but life is short. Seek out really great ones to make the best use of your time.

### Chase the truth

People sacrifice the truth in favour of agreeability, acceptance, and protection of their identity. But eschewing these things for truth gets you better outcomes in the long-run.

### Don’t chase status

Status is a game of appearances: optimizing for it makes you hollow and dependent on someone else's brand. Focus instead on fundamentals and what actually changes the world for the better.

### Focus on the future not the present

The present is dominated by those who planned yesterday: the game is already lost. Focus on the frontier where you have the space and headstart to make a difference.

### Max not average score

Focusing on average score leads to overoptimization for the short-term and incremental work. Focusing on a maximum score allows you to focus on breakthroughs and the ideas that really count.

### Set ambitious timelines.

Targets affect the underlying reality which in turn changes the appropriateness of the target. So it's better to be ambitious as possible so people don't anchor to a slower timetable.

# Mentality

**Summary:** The difference between success and failure often comes down to who cares the most. Intelligence is necessary but not sufficient. But it is also about being truthful to yourself and committing to reality not perception.

### Extreme focus and hard work

Single-mindedness is one of the most powerful traits. It often has side-effects, like neglecting other parts of life, but it is a major competitive advantage if you are thinking and working more than other people. Most great achievements are not won without hard work. In startups, you are essentially trading off 40-50 years of a career for 2 years of work. There is no balanced route to success. It requires manicial focus.

### Care the most to win to most

You can work hard on something, but you may not actually care about it. But caring often makes the difference: if you can't sleep because of the possibility of new ideas, if you dream about what your work, if you mull around ideas for fun -- all these things mean you are working and thinking more than someone who cares less.

### Shock your identity

"Your progress is proportional to your tolerance to embarrassment". If you aren't being embarrassed, then you are not putting yourself in situations where you can learn. Those who learn a lot have a high personality half-life, and strong levels of disassociation with past versions of themselves, because they are learning at a fast rate.

### Seek the freedom to make mistakes

The most beautiful thing about my first startup was that if things failed it was all me. It wasn't some mish-mash failure of people in a big organization; it wasn't John Smith from department X; it wasn't the CEO. It was all on me. There is no better way to learn.

### Fuel yourself with failure 

There's a cliche that artists do their best work after relationship breakups. I've found this to be true in general: when you fail it really motivates you emotionally to push forward and show others what you are really about. Treating failure as a beginning rather than an ending is usually the start of great journey. 

### Focus on a single thing 

Multi-tasking is the death of productivity. You usually need to go deep on a problem to really understand it and gain insights. It's an anti-pattern if you are working on lots of orthogonal pieces of work. You need to commit to one of them and really focus.

### Keep yourself accountable by telling the truth.

Ask a startup person how it's going, and they'll always tell you it's going amazing. Then you'll quietly hear two months later that they've shut down the business. Screw perceptions: tell the truth, don't inflate things, and hold yourself accountable. Give yourself an incentive to actually fix things by embarrassing yourself by telling others how chaotic and shit things may have been.

### Be your fiercest critic.

Wrestle with your own ideas and try to kill them. Play the other side: like a court that's assessing the pros and cons of what you currently believe or hold to. Anything you pursue or believe should be subjected to a barrage of criticism so only the fittest ideas survive.

### Destiny is a useful fiction 

I believe in destiny. It's a useful fiction that propels you forward. Humans have an agency bias that overattributes things to individual willpower rather than random events. I actively exploit this fiction as it pushes me to work harder: because *I'm* the one who is meant to succeed and I will succeed - and I actually believe this.

### One life, make it count.

Question yourself whether you are spending your time productively. Work on problems that could be your last problems.

### The ones who think they’ve failed the exam get 100%

They think about all the details, and all the things they could have said, and all the implications, and so on... Obsessives prepare and think more, and agonize about the last 1% of performance - so they are the ones who end up doing well.

### Don’t underestimate yourself

It's easy to fail by not taking opportunities because you think others are smarter or more capable. The majority of failure comes from failing to try rather than trying and then failing.

### Seek freedom from others’ judgement 

My goal in my twenties was always to get enough freedom to escape someone else's judgement. This would allow me to build the world I wanted to build. In practice, you are still subject to constraints: e.g. in a startup you still have to answer to investors. But as you become more successful you should have more freedom.

### Constraints make you stronger

Abundance allows you to be lazy and take shortcuts. Constraints make you think deeply, requires more effort, and generate more learnings (and adaptability). It's a better learning environment.

### Hardships make you stronger

The most amazing people usually have overcome obstacles to achieve great things. It's a better learning environment.

### Ride out bumps in the road.

Most setbacks are temporary, no matter how painful. Slow down if you need but don't give up.

### Fortress mentality

The world is not actually against you, but what an amazing motivator to prove the bastards wrong.

### Fighters over dancers

Dance is subjective; fighting is objective. Dancing is subject to persuasion, fashion and temporary factors. Fighting is more black and white. Seek the black and white not the grey areas where truth goes to die.

### You usually haven't seen it all before

Be open-minded. Think about how a new situation might be different in important way, rather than focusing on factors you have experienced before. 

### No credit for dealing with things people can’t see

You don't get credit for fighting private battles. So be it: the only person you need to prove anything to is yourself, not other people.

### Don’t cosplay as who you want to be.

It is easy to pretend you are something you are not. Don't settle for fiction: you only live once.

### Own your failures to own the future

When you fuck up, admit it publicly; embarrass yourself publicly. You'll be one-step ahead of most people, who enter a phase of denial and try to explain away their mistakes or pretend they're successful along some other dimension.

# Creativity

**Summary:** Shaping the future requires creativity. Often the building blocks of the future already lay around you. The Eureka moment comes from combining things that people hadn't noticed before, often exploiting an analogy or point of similarity. But this requires getting off the plane of conventional thinking, and these principles tell you how.

### Eureka

Aha, ha, ahh! Why do we make these sounds when we make a new discovery, tell a joke, or see art? Because we saw something that "should have been obvious" but that surprised us. It was hidden there all along, but we didn't notice it. Why didn't we notice it? Because we were interpreting a thing on its dominant frame of reference, how it is used in the present, rather than noticing another frame of reference in which it could be used. Creativity is the art of getting to these other frames of reference.

### Resist presentable ideas; seek the controversial.

The more presentable an idea, the more it appeals to conventional wisdom. But the truly great ideas overturn conventional wisdom. Don't expect them to gain widespread acceptance at first.

### Never look to the present for ideas

Figure out what the future needs from first principles and build it (breakthrough work), rather than carrying forward present assumptions (incremental work).

### Ignore popular things and people

Seek misfits and crackpots. Newton dabbled in alchemy as well as calculus: there's a reason for that. Crackpot ideas may not always be right, but at least they escape the present.

### Seek out things you disagree with

Often the most useful books are useful in the negative: they are flawed in some way. They make you think about the underlying reasons why an argument might be wrong. Books you already agree with tend to reinforce priors rather than question them.

### Learn the rules so you can break them

You won't have good insights if you don't know the fundamentals of a field, because details matter. At the same time, you won't make breakthroughs by following all the rules. Art is knowing which rules to break.

### When everyone is going left, consider going right.

Contrarian thinking for its own sake can be stupid, but societal bias is towards acceptance and convention. Most people follow the crowd because it requires less cognitive effort. You should try to work out for yourself, from first principles, which direction to go.

### Originality counts even in failure

More lessons are learnt from failing original ideas, rather than failing incremental ideas - because the former is based on challenging assumptions, the latter on reinforcing them.

### Find insights in unusual places.

Some of the best ideas in science were cross-pollinated from other fields.

### The first stab at an idea is usually wrong.

The initial idea will be based on superficial insights and laden with convention. You usually need to go deeper before you get to something insightful.

---------------------------------------

# Methodology

**Summary:** Having the right objective and mentality is not sufficient if your methodology is flawed. Getting to your goal requires good positioning, speed of execution, experimentation, and processes of learning. These are summarized below.

### Ride the wave

Think of creative periods in history: usually it wasn't a single person, but there was a particular location or scene where ideas were flourishing. You should aim to position yourself in places where a "rising tide lifts all boats". Even if your first attempt in a field doesn't succeed, you can probably carve out a specialty and be carried by the overall progress and interest in the field.

### Chase exponentials

The field you target may backed by an exponential that you can extrapolate into the future. For example, Moore's Law was a sign that microcomputing would become more viable in the future. The explosion of the Internet was a sign that ec-ommerce was going to be how people were going to do their shopping. These exponentials are often where you can build for the future rather than the present - by predicting what will become possible and what assumptions can be overturned. 

### Move fast!

Most good ideas tap into a fundamental use case that requires a lot less effort to validate than you think. If people don’t bite at the core idea or insight, something is wrong. Additionally, people tend to underestimate what they can achieve if they really push on something. The recent successes in vaccine development are a good example of this.

### Build to inform

Often you build not to present a final product, but to gain information or insights. This tells you what to build and focus on next. Usually great products aren't built in one-shot, but are constructed by farming insights from previous experiments.

### Kill your ideas, don’t try to confirm them.

Too many people set out to confirm ideas rather than kill them. So when evidence comes around, they fit it to the expectation they had. This means they cling to a pet idea for too long. Ideas should have to survive a brutal environment. They shouldn't be protected.

### Change your mind when new evidence arises

Be objective: don't give more credence to an idea because it's your pet idea.

### Explorers over Exploiters

Explore or exploit? Too many people favour exploitation due to status quo bias and risk aversion. But those who explore, for example different career paths, tend to learn to generalize and adapt better to new situations. And they are the ones who usually pounce (and succeed) when the world changes.

### Tell the truth, and teach others to deal with it

A good working environment is comfortable with the truth and criticism.

### Don’t moronically praise everything

You are polluting signal and promoting an environment of agreeability over truth.

### Listen to other people and feedback seriously

Don't hear what you want to hear. Listen and incorporate the feedback.

### Ensemble viewpoints to come to the correct answer

Weigh feedback based on expertise and past track record.

### Measure what you do

Don't judge success based on subjective feel, but on objective metrics.

### What gets measured gets done

If you want to optimize a single thing, quantify and record it, and hold yourself accountable to that progress.

### You often win with a quiet game

A good way to win a game of Risk is to get others to argue so you can play a quiet game, build up, and strike at the opportune moment. Life can be like this: being underestimated can be a great thing. Don't feel the need to seek attention all the time.

### Know when to quit

It's hard to quit some things because it feels like failure. But the real failure is often staying too long: there are risks of staying as well as risks of leaving. Don't feel you owe anyone anything by staying. It's your life.

### Don't fight battles you can't win

No amount of determination or intelligence can overcome a bad situation. Go somewhere else where you can win.

### Values should target the tails

Most company values are truisms. The art is selecting which ones to emphasise. Usually these are ones that, if not followed, lead to the biggest shortfalls in performance. To grab attention, they also usually need to be controversial to make people think and act differently (rather than being agreeable and "obvious").

### Decentralize operations

Aim to have a team where people have a high degree of initiative and ability to tackle problems independently. This may require training, but it leads to better results than top-down management, and a more flexible team that can adapt quickly to new needs.

### Meetings are the death of productivity

Never introduce formal structure unless it's absolutely necessary for communication.

### Read the tells in a conversation

Always read between the lines to find out what people's true motivations are. Most content in conversation is filler and a means-to-an-end to extract some signal about the other person. That's why things like body language are so important even though they don't directly signify anything.

### Prepare fiercely for critical moments

Sometimes there are events that can make-or-break your success. Do more than the minimum preparation required: don't wing it.

### Don’t neglect your health

Exercise and eat properl.

### Intelligence is reductive not expansive.

The hallmark of intelligence is not detail, but reduction of detail to principle. Principles generalize; details don't.

### Have a confidence value for everything

When someone speaks as if they have 100% confidence in something, that's a failure of method. Society teaches people to speak in this way to be heard. It's wrong. Be explicit about how confident you actually are. The goal is not to win an argument but to find the truth.

### Rewards are BS when metrics exist

Focus on real achievements not appearances and status.

### Lead by example 

Demonstrate through your own work what you ask of other people.

### What you use, you should try to understand

Most people take things they use for granted - e.g. how does this laptop I'm using actually work? But you should take time to go deeper on some of these things that are important in your life. Because eventually you might want to modify them for your own needs.

### Time is everything

Recognize opportunities when they emerge and act quickly to seize them.

# People

**Summary:** Learn how to size up other people and decide who you want to work with and how you want to deal with them.

### Judge people by what THEY have DONE

Not where they were or who they worked with.

Society is deeply flawed at making these type of judgements. For example, in the UK an Oxbridge degree is everything; and a role at a big company is seen as prestigious. The reality is that Oxbridge overoptimizes for people who are good at passing examinations; the reality is big companies are often slow, risk-averse and conservative.

The ONLY thing that matters is what someone has actually done. For example, did they do hobby projects that got shitloads of community traction? Did they do any original entrepreneurial work in their spare time, or something that required a high level of initiative and independent work?

### Don't assume successful people are supremely talented

More likely, they have baseline intelligence and were well-positioned to succeed. Would most billionaires still be billionaires if the world was re-run? They probably would have been successful, but maybe not as successful.

### Prove people wrong by proving them right

When someone doesn't rate you, they don't rate the present version of you. But if you learn, evolve, and then execute, then you've proven them wrong by proving them right: your past version of yourself couldn't succeed, but by changing, you learnt to succeed.

### Don't waste your time on the wrong people

A lot of times we know people from situational context, e.g. friends from school or university. You have no commitment to these people if you no longer gain satisfaction hanging out or working with them. Don't feel you need to keep something going that no longer gives you happiness.

### Groups optimize for agreeability not truth

The optimal contribution to a group conversation is agreeable. Truth, in contrast, can be controversial and alienating.

### Focus on actions not words for signal

If someone says they'll come back to you, but they don't come back to you - they don't care. If someone says a problem is interesting, but they've done nothing to solve it themselves, they don't care. 

### Big groups can't move quickly

The optimal team size is under ten people.

### Incumbents are slow not scary

Most incumbent companies scare off new entrants by getting scale and talent. But they are actually quite slow moving in a lot of cases, and a startup can easily outmanuevre them. Those in the big company will be stuck in meetings all day rather than actually working.

### Don't hero-worship people

They're only human, after all.

### Hire people who are original rather than textbook learners

People you hire should express insightful, original thoughts that make you think differently. Textbook answers show competence, but not the ability to go beyond the already-known.

### Those who mock big ideas are the ones who are crushed by them

"He's one of these crazy people who thinks he can actually change things" was a common mantra when I was in the Government. In the long-run, those who resist ideas are the ones who fall behind when things change.

### Don't let critics get you down

It is not the critic who counts.

### Do the minimum necessary to please others so you can focus on the truth

In reality, you have to play the game somewhat. But be careful not to fall into the trap of optimizing purely to please others.

### Don’t trust writers over doers. Storytelling is fiction; messiness is real life.

People give too much respect to people who produce opinionated blog posts, newsletters, podcasts and essays. Usually these are not evidence-based, and the person writing them may not have experience with the details of the problems they are writing about. If you have to read anything, read academic papers or evidence-slanted literature, or accounts from people with experience on the ground. 

### Focus on the person in the room who gives the most original insights, rather than recycles talking points.

Talking points optimize for agreeability: it's wasted time compared to actual insights and new information.

### Don’t reason with people who can’t be reasoned with.

Many people are driven by emotion not reason, and will not change their mind with evidence.

### Ignore opinionated people without achievements

Self-explanatory.

### Pay attention to those who change a lot since you last saw them.

They are the ones who are learning.

### Rich kids are usually dumb kids unless they’ve imposed hardships on themselves.

If someone is privileged and they haven't achieved or experienced much: avoid them like the plague. They have had the weakest learning environment out of anyone.

### The ones who talk a big game are usually the ones who have big breakdowns when they fail

Because they are so protective of their social identity that they can't handle it when they are found out.

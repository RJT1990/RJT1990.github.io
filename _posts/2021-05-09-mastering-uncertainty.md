# Mastering Uncertainty

> I confess that I am a dreamer. Someone once called me just a dreamer. That offended me, the just part; being a real dreamer is hard work. It really gets hard when you start believing your dreams.

I hit thirty last September. I was meaning to put together a blog post with lessons from my twenties. It didn't come to anything as I was continually unhappy with my drafting. But recently I have been mentoring several people with startups, and I felt the need to revisit what I've actually learnt. I thought about how best to present this, and decided to summarize the lessons in the form of principles (thanks Ray Dalio). I think this is more generalizable than storytelling, which tends to oversimplify and post-rationalize real events, and thematic topics, which tend to be too high-level and omit important factors. Being aphoristic gets the right balance of being low-level, but also generalizable and not tying too closely to a particular experience.

You should skim-read this to find principles that catch your attention. If you follow my advice carefully, you'll notice this blog post is a "ladder to climb to throw away": the real punch of my advice is to learn and do things yourself. But hopefully by ingraining a subset of these principles, you can find shortcuts to better outcomes. Pay particular attention to the advice that seems "unnatural" as this is where you'll want to overcome some of your inbuilt biases.

I also make no claim that these principles are fool-proof or that they are the only way to good outcomes. This is just a single perspective, so take what you need or find useful.

## Objectives

To achieve anything you need to set yourself an objective to work towards. But this is where many slip up before they've even started. People tend to underestimate what they can achieve in the long-term, and overestimate the strength of obstacles in their way.

### Aim big

Always work towards the possibility of an extremely good outcome. These types of opportunity come with a risk penalty, but it is usually overestimated due to loss aversion and other behavioural biases.

### Usually it’s not impossible

Unless the laws of physics forbade it, work towards it.

### Great ideas over good ones

There is no shortage of good ideas, but life is short. Seek out really great ones to make the best use of your time.

### Chase the truth

Who doesn't chase the truth? A lot of people: because they value other things such as agreeability, acceptance, and fear of threatening their identity. But sacrificing these things for truthseeking gets you better outcomes in the long-run.

### Value results above all else

Ditch anything that doesn't get results, no matter the frictions or historical commitments.

### Don’t chase status

My biggest mistake in my early career was getting a reward from doing something "prestigious" in Government. Status is a game of appearances: optimizing for it makes you hollow and dependent on someone else's brand. Focus instead on fundamentals and what actually makes a difference.

### Focus on 5 years down the line, not the here and now

The present is dominated by those who planned for the future yesterday. The game is already lost. Focus instead on the frontier where you have the space and headstart to make a difference

### Max over achievements not average

Focusing on average score leads to overoptimization for short-term achievements and incremental work. Focusing on a maximum score allows you to focus on breakthroughs and the ideas that really count.

### Set ambitious timelines.

Targets affect the underlying reality which in turn changes the appropriateness of the target. So better to go ambitious as possible so people don't anchor to a slower timetable.



## Mentality

The difference between success and failure often comes down to who cares the most. Intelligence is necessary but not sufficient.

### Extreme focus and hard work

Single-mindedness is one of the most powerful traits. It often has side-effects, like neglecting other parts of life, but it is a major competitive advantage if you are thinking and working more than other people. Most great achievements are not won without hard work. In startups, you are essentially trading off 40-50 years of a career for 2 years of work. There is no balanced route to success. It requires manicial focus.

### Care the most to win to most

You can work hard on something, but you may not actually care about something. But caring often makes the difference: if you can't sleep because of the possibility of new ideas, if you dream about what you work on, if you mull around ideas for fun -- all these things mean you are working and thinking more than someone who cares less.

### Shock your identity

Your progress is proportional to your tolerance to embarrassment. If you aren't being embarrassed, then you are not putting yourself in situations where you can learn. Those who learn a lot have a high personality half-life, and strong levels of disassociation with past versions of themselves, because they are learning at a fast rate.

### Seek the freedom to make mistakes

The most beautiful thing about my first startup was that if things failed it was all me. It wasn't some mish-mash failure of people in a big organization; it wasn't John Smith from department X; it wasn't the CEO. It was all on me. There is no better way to learn.

### Fuel yourself with failure 

There's a cliche that artists do their best work after relationship breakups. I've found this to be true more generally: when you fail it really motivates you emotionally to push forward and show others what you are really about. Treating failure as a beginning rather than an ending is usually the start of great journey. 

### Focus on a single thing 

Multi-tasking is the death of productivity. You usually need to go deep on a problem to really understand it and gain insights. It's usually an anti-pattern if you are working on lots of orthogonal pieces of work. You need to commit to one of them and really focus.

### Keep yourself accountable by telling the truth and not inflating things.

Ask a startup person how it's going, and they'll always tell you it's going amazing. Then you'll quietly hear two months later that they've shut down the business. Screw perceptions: tell the truth and hold yourself accountable. Give yourself an incentive to actually fix things by embarrassing yourself by telling others how chaotic and shit things may have been.

### Be your fiercest critic.

Don't just present ideas when you haven't even wrestled with them in your own head first. Try to kill them. Try to play the other side: like a fantasy court that's assessing the pros and cons of what you currently believe or hold to. Anything you pursue or believe should be subjected to a barrage of criticism so only the fittest ideas and beliefs survive.

### Destiny is a useful fiction 

I am not religious, but I believe in destiny. How stupid is that? How can I claim to care about truth if I believe in destiny? Because it's a useful fiction that propels you forward. It's a sort of agency bias which humans have, which is to overattribute things to individual willpower rather than random events, but I like to actively play into this fiction as it pushes me to work harder: because *I'm* the one who is meant to succeed and I will succeed. 

### One life, make it count.

Question yourself whether you are spending your time productively. Work on problems that could be your last problems.

### The ones who think they’ve failed the exam are the ones who get 100%

The ones who think they've done well often aren't thinking enough about all the details, and all the things they could have said, and all the implications, and so on... Obsessives prepare and think more, and tend to do really well, but are also the ones who agonize about the last 1%.

### Don’t underestimate yourself.

It's easy to fail by not taking opportunities because you think others are smarter or more capable. The biggest proportion of failure comes from failing to try rather than trying and then failing.

### Seek freedom from others’ judgement 

My goal in my twenties was always to get enough freedom to escape someone else's judgement. This would allow me to build the world I wanted to build. In practice, you are still subject to constraints: e.g. in a startup you still have to answer to investors. But as you become more successful you should (in theory) have more freedom to do things the way you want to do them.

### Constraints make you stronger

Abundance allows you to be lazy and take shortcuts. Constraints make you think deeply, requires more effort, and generate more learnings (and adaptability). It's a better learning environment.

### Hardships make you stronger

The most amazing people usually have overcome obstacles to achieve great things. It's a better learning environment.

### Ride out bumps in the road.

Most setbacks are temporary, no matter how painful. Slow down if you need to but don't give up.

### Fortress mentality

The world is not actually against you, but what an amazing motivator to prove those bastards wrong.

### Fighters over dancers

Dance is subjective; fighting is objective. Dancing is subject to persuasion, fashion and temporary factors. Fighting is more black and white.

### You usually haven't seen it all before

Be open-minded. Think about how a new situation might be critically different in important way, rather than focusing on the other factors which you have experienced before. 

### You won’t get credit for dealing with things people can’t see

One of the most depressing things in life is when you are dealing with a lot, but you don't get credit for it.  So be it: the only person you need to prove anything to is yourself, not other people.

### Don’t cosplay as who you want to be.

It is easy to pretend you are something you are not. But you only have one life: how about actually achieving something? Don't settle for fiction.

### Own your failures to own the future

When you fuck up, admit it publicly; embarrass yourself publicly. You'll already be one-step ahead of most people, who enter a phase of denial and try to explain away their mistakes or pretend they're successful along some other dimension. 


## Creativity

Shaping the future requires a high degree of creativity. Often the building blocks of the future already lay around you. The Eureka moment comes from combining two things that people hadn't noticed before, often exploiting an analogy or point of similarity or difference. But this requires getting off the plane of conventional thinking. These principles tell you how to get off that track.

### Resist presentable ideas; seek out controversial ones.

The more presentable an idea, the more it appeals to conventional wisdom. But the truly great ideas overturn conventional wisdom. Don't expect them to gain widespread acceptance at first.

### Never look to the present for ideas; extrapolate to the future.

If your ideas take the form "Tinder for x" then you are thinking incrementally, and making reference to the present. You are relying on present assumptions rather than overturning them.

### Popular things are conventional; seek unconventional things.

Seek misfits and crackpots. Newton dabbled in alchemy as well as calculus: there's a reason for that. Crackpot ideas may not always be right, but at least they escape the present.

### When everyone is going left, consider going right.

Contrarian thinking for it's own sake can be stupid, but societal bias is clearly towards acceptance and conventional thinking. Most people follow the crowd because it requires less effort. You should always work out for yourself, from first principles, which direction to go - and be invariant to the swing of popular opinion.

### When all else fails, value originality.

More lessons are learnt from failing original ideas, rather than failing incremental ideas. If you're playing the long-game, 

### Find insights in unusual places.

### First stab at an idea is usually wrong.

### Ideas come from buddy cation;: aha, ha.

### Very few people are successful on the first try

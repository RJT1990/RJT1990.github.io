I live in London and I work as a research engineer on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) at Facebook AI. Previously I was the CTO and cofounder of [Atlas ML](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/facebook-quietly-acquired-atlast-ml/), a London based machine learning startup. Prior to startups I worked as a quantitative analyst, first in the gambling sector and then in finance. I've also dabbled in open source, including building a time-series library for Python called [PyFlux](https://github.com/RJT1990/pyflux). In a previous life I was also policy advisor at HM Treasury, and before that I did web development in my teens. I previously studied economics at Cambridge.

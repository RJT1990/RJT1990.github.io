# About

I live in London and I work as a research engineer on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) at Facebook AI. Previously I was the CTO and cofounder of Atlas ML, a London based machine learning startup. My experience prior to startups was working as a quantitative analyst, first in the gambling sector and then in finance. In a previous life I was also policy advisor at HM Treasury, and before that I did web development in my teens. I previously studied economics at Cambridge.

# About

I am an AI researcher / developer building a new startup in London.

Previously I worked at Meta AI, leading the reasoning work for LLaMA 3. Before that I led the research on Galactica, which was the first LLM from Meta to achieve state-of-the-art results on key benchmarks. Before that I co-created the Papers with Code platform. Before that I was co-founder and CTO of a London-based startup that was acquired by Facebook in 2019.

I am technical generalist, and have done many other things in my career so far including professional sports betting, quant finance, and policy work at the UK Government. Since 2017 I have been focused on AI.
